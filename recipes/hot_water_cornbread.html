    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This <strong>deep-fried</strong> hot water cornbread might be the most Southern of all Southern cornbreads. The taste is very familiar, but that <em>crusty, crispy exterior</em> makes it new and exciting.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups cornmeal</li>
        <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups boiling water</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter</li>
        <li>3 cups vegetable oil for frying, or as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine cornmeal, flour, sugar, salt, and baking powder in a bowl and whisk thoroughly until well mixed.</li>
        <li>Pour in water, and carefully mix with a spoon until combined. Add butter and mix with a spoon until combined. </li>
        <li>Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Use a spoon or ice cream scoop to transfer 8 equal portions onto the prepared pan. Cover with plastic and press with your hands to form smooth patties about 1-inch thick.</li>
        <li>For best results, chill dough in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour before frying. If needed, dough can be fried as soon as it is made.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a deep fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), or heat oil, 1/2-inch deep in a heavy skillet to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Deep fry cornbread in the preheated deep fryer (or pan-fry in the preheated skillet) until nicely browned, about 3 minutes per side. Let cool about 10 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
